###JS Module Pattern kata
#####Adopted from Kyle Simpson's FrontEnd Masters - Advanced JS exercise (ex2)  
######I just took the concept and reused his html and css -- Thanks Kyle!

-- 
###Purpose - practice the module pattern using vanilla JS
1. Create a module w/ public and private apis

2. The module should...
  - load existing (default) notes
  - allow user to submit new notes that are added to note list 
  - highlight clicked notes on/off (toggle behavior)

####Public API should expose the following methods:
  - **loadNotes** load default notes e.g. `NoteManager.loadNotes();`
  - **init** expose basic UI (defined above) on document.ready e.g. `NoteManager.init()`
